        I am a full-stack developer with a long-standing passion for software development and
        continuous learning. I build reliable, scalable web platforms with a focus on clean
        architecture, maintainable code, and pragmatic technical decisions aligned with business
        needs.

        My core experience is centered around Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, complemented by
        Supabase, workflow automation with n8n, and AI/LLM integrations, including RAG-based
        architectures. I also work comfortably in mixed environments with Angular frontends and
        Django/DRF backends.
